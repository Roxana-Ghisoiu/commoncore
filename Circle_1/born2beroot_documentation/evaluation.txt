Q: What is virtual machine?
A: Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a computer resource that uses software instead of a physical computer 
to run programs and deploy apps.
Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs,
even when they are all running on the same host. For example,if you want, you can run a
virtual windows, Linux or MacOS machine on a physical PC. 

Q: What it's purpose?
A: VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs,
to run software that requires a different operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.
